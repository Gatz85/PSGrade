PSGrade
This is PSGrade, it does a valid key !!
added a valid key to key.h and it worked!!
And thanks to KaKaRoToKS and the other people that made this work!!
const uint8_t jig_key[20] = {
0x04, 0x4E, 0x61, 0x1B, 0xA6, 0xA6, 0xE3, 0x9A, 0x98, 0xCF,
0x35, 0x81, 0x2C, 0x80, 0x68, 0xC7, 0xFC, 0x5F, 0x7A, 0xE8
};

Just like Psgroove make sure you set your board to the right one
for now refer to psgroove will update the Readme later and add a 
build all script
